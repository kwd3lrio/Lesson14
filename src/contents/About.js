        <h4> Hello there, </h4>

        <h1> My name is Kristian W. Del-Rio</h1>

        <h3> Front-End <u>Web Developer </u> | UI/UX <u> Designer </u> and Graphic <u>Designer</u> </h3>

        <p>
          Started getting into computers ever since my parents owned an IBM with "one" floppy disk drive and a 256 RGB monitor.

          Jump to a couple decades later and graduated with a Bachelor Degree in Graphic Design. I also have an Associates Degree in Web Development.
          
          My interest  is in the design of coding user interaction for web apps and websites. I enjoy making UI components that are user friendly and are inclusive accessible to all users: regardless of mental or physical impediments.
